<h1>PocketRace</h1>
I'm Mose, a 17-year-old from just outside Stockholm, Sweden. I created this app because most other race-timing applications are costly and geared toward large-scale events. My aim with PocketRace is to provide an easy-to-use solution for smaller clubs and groups, allowing them to organize their races without the high costs.
